\title{Filter a \code{SNPdata} object}
\usage{
filter(
  snpdata,
  min_qual = 1000L,
  max_missing_sites = 0.2,
  max_missing_samples = 0.2,
  maf_cutoff = 0.01,
  hard = FALSE,
  soft = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{snpdata}{An object of class \code{SNPdata}}

\item{min_qual}{An integer that represents the The minimum call quality
score. Loci with a quality score below this will be discarded.
Default is 1000.}

\item{max_missing_sites}{A numeric representing the maximum fraction of
missing sites above which a sample should be dropped. Default is 0.2.}

\item{max_missing_samples}{A numeric representing the maximum fraction of
missing samples above which a loci should be discarded. Default is 0.2.}

\item{maf_cutoff}{A numeric representing the minor allele frequency cut-off.
Loci with a \code{MAF < maf_cutoff} will be discarded.}
}
\value{
a filtered \code{SNPdata} object
}
\description{
SNPs and samples are filtered based on the user-specified thresholds. Both
the \code{meta}, \code{details} and the different genotype tables will be affected
depending on the filtration conditions.
